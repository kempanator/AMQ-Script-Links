# AMQ-Script-Links

This repository compile links to install scripts for AMQ. These scripts should all be checked by mods, and allowed to be used freely on AMQ (as long as no heavy edits is done to them).

They are classified in categories:

- [mandatory](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/mandatory#mandatory): starter kit for any player.
- [design](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/design#design): scripts which change the design/layout of AMQ, generally solely for aesthetic purposes.
- [visual features](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/visual%20features#visual-features): add new visual features, new information that isn't available in vanilla AMQ.
- [gameplay](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/gameplay#gameplay): scripts which changes how some aspect of the game works, or add new features to it.
- [gamemode](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/gamemode#gamemode): scripts that will help you play some new game modes alone or with your friends.
- [tools](https://github.com/xSardine/AMQ-Script-Links/tree/main/tools#tools): various tools that will not affect your AMQ experience directly.

You need two browser extensions that will let you use most of these scripts:

- [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) (this link is for chromium)

Some script will get automatically added to tampermonkey, other will need you to add them manually. To do so, left click on the tampermonkey icon, top right of your browser, and select `create a new script`. Copy and paste the script content there. Follow the documentation of each script for more complexe installation.

The tab must be refresh for new script to be accounted.
