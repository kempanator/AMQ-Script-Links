- ## <ins>4Lajf's Training Mode</ins>

This script is a superset of Kempanator's Custom Song List Game. Make sure to only have either Training Mode or Custom Song List activated at a time.

It will function like Anki, meaning that it will apply a weighted system to the songs so that the songs you know less will appear more often.
