## [Juvian's No Dropdown](https://github.com/amq-script-project/AMQ-Scripts/blob/master/gameplay/amqNoDropdown.user.js)

Disables dropdown for that extra taste of rage. Use ctrl + b to enable/disable dropdown. Useful when you join "No DD" lobbies !

## [Bob's Buzzer](https://files.catbox.moe/lipeqk.js)

When you recognize a song, mute the audio by clicking the volume icon next to the slider.
Then, enter your answer in the answer bar. Do not unmute your audio (if you do, it will be counted as a missed buzzer).
Your audio will be automatically unmuted going into the results phase, and when the next song is loaded.

The time taken to hit the buzzer, as well as whether or not your answer was correct, will be posted in the chat.
