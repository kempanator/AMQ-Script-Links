## [Joseph's Song List UI](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqSongListUI.user.js)

Adds a window which lists all of the songs that play during a quiz in real time (during answer reveal phase). This window can be opened by pressing the "Song List" icon at the top right of the quiz screen (the same place where you change video resolution, volume and open the room settings) or by pressing the Pause/Break key on the keyboard ([more info](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts#song-list-ui-amqsonglistuiuserjs))

---

## [Joseph's Rig Tracker](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/amqRigTracker.user.js)

Counts how many times each person's list has appeared during a quiz (Note: only counts if the player has "Share Entries" enabled in their AMQ list settings) ([more info](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts#rig-tracker-amqrigtrackeruserjs))

---

## [Juvian's Expand Library](https://github.com/amq-script-project/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/gameplay/amqExpandLibrary.user.js)

Makes it more ugly and efficient. Expand library is unusable for big lists without this script.

## [Nyamu's Colorful AMQ](https://github.com/nyamu-amq/amq_scripts/blob/master/amqHighlightFriends.user.js)

Apply different coloring to some stuff to highlight them, such as friends in the lobby. ([more info](https://github.com/nyamu-amq/amq_scripts#amqhighlightfriendsuserjs)).

## [Zol's Answer Time Display](https://github.com/amq-script-project/AMQ-Scripts/raw/master/gameplay/amqPlayerAnswerTimeDisplay.user.js)
